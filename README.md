# speech-recognition-mk1

This project transcribes the YouTube video in real time using the built-in SpeechRecognition provided by the web browser.

For this project to work you need to:
1. Install Loopback
2. Create a virtual device with your web browser as an input
3. Select your virtual device as your system input device

After Loopback is set up:
1. Press the start button to start speech recognition
2. Allow the browser access to the microphone (if prompted)
3. Press the play button on the video
4. Watch as the video is magically transcribed in real time
